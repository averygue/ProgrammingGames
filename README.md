# ProgrammingGames

This course will explore the algorithms, data structures, and tricks used to program computer video games. We will be programming in Java using the JavaFX media library and focussing on arcade-style video games (new and "classic") rather than text-based adventures or strategy games such as chess.

Assignments:
  1. Create a basic image using shapes and colors
  2. Created a basic reaction time game for the sake of practicing with animation.
